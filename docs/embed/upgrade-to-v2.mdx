## Steps to upgrade to v2

If you are using the old version of the Pingback Embeddable Form, you can upgrade to the new version by following the steps below.

### Step 1: Update the script tag

Update the script tag to use the new version of the Pingback Embeddable Form.

#### Old version:

```html
<script src="https://widget.pingback.com"></script>
```

#### New version:

```html
<script src="https://widget-v2.pingback.com/assets/js/widget.js"></script>
```

### Step 2: Update the embeddable form tag

Update the embeddable form tag to use the new version of the Pingback Embeddable Form.

#### Old version:

```html
<pb-embeddable-form
  channel_id="YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"
  segment_id="YOUR_SEGMENT_ID"
  product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID"
  locale="en"
  theme_mode="light"
  theme_color="purple-classic"
  call_to_action="Subscribe"
  thanks_message="Subscription successful!"
  redirect_url="https://example.com"
  fields='[{"id":"name","label":"Name","type":"name"},{"id":"email","label":"E-mail","type":"email"},{"id":"phone","label":"Phone","type":"phone"}]'
></pb-embeddable-form>
```

#### New version:

```html
<pb-embeddable-form form_id="YOUR_FORM_ID"></pb-embeddable-form>
```

As you can see, the new version is much simpler and easier to use. All the fields and settings are pre-configured during form creation in the [Form Page](https://pingback.com/publish/forms/list/new-form) and loaded automatically by form ID.

For more information about the new version, please refer to the [v2 documentation](/docs/embed/v2/introduction).
